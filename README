Basic File Structure
---------------------

Admin
-----

    Administrative - Not Sure what That means yet

Utils
-----

    General Purpose Utilites that are not specific to this
    package and may be used independently outside of it.
    Currently this includes a minimal Templating Engine
    It also has path checking, joining, currying, (os.path stuff)
    It also has all custom exceptions

Templates
---------

    General Configuration Files for random packages, to be used with
    the templating engine included in Utils. Currently contains apache
    and nginx config files.

Engines
-------

    Package Installers that can be used standalone, as well as the base class
    BaseEngine.py

Interacts
---------

    Pairwise resolution between two packages.

Deployments
-----------

    Code generation, more powerful dependency resolution, and automation
    systems. This does the heavy work or tieing everything together.
    Not currently implemented.
